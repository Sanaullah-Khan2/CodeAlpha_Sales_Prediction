# CodeAlpha_Sales_Prediction
This project is a part of my learning journey in data science and machine learning. The goal is to build a predictive model that estimates future sales based on historical data using various product, store, and time.related features.


Task Description:

Sales performance can be influenced by multiple features such as:  
. Date  
. Sales Amount  
. Item Category  
. Store Location  
. Promotional Offers  


Technologies Used:

. Python  
. pandas  
. numpy  
. seaborn  
. matplotlib  
. scikit.learn  
. joblib  



Machine Learning Algorithm:

. Linear Regression was used to train the predictive model.  
. The trained model is saved as `sales_model.pkl` for future use.


Project Workflow:

1. Data Loading from CSV  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using visualizations  
3. Data Preparation (feature engineering and cleaning)  
4. Train.Test Split  
5. Model Training using Linear Regression  
6. Model Evaluation using regression metrics  
7. Model Saving using joblib  


Results:

 The model achieved good performance on the test data. Evaluation includes:
 
. Mean Squared Error (MSE): 3.1740973539761033  
. RÂ² Score: 0.899438024100912
